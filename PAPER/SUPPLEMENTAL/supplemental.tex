%% Uncomment one of the lines above depending on where your paper is
%% in the conference process. ``review'' and ``widereview'' are for review
%% submission, ``preprint'' is for pre-publication, and the final version
%% doesn't use a specific qualifier.

%% Please use one of the ``review'' options in combination with the
%% assigned online id (see below) ONLY if your paper uses a double blind
%% review process. Some conferences, like IEEE Vis and InfoVis, have NOT
%% in the past.

%% Please note that the use of figures other than the optional teaser is not permitted on the first page
%% of the journal version.  Figures should begin on the second page and be
%% in CMYK or Grey scale format, otherwise, colour shifting may occur
%% during the printing process.  Papers submitted with figures other than the optional teaser on the
%% first page will be refused. Also, the teaser figure should only have the
%% width of the abstract as the template enforces it.

%% These few lines make a distinction between latex and pdflatex calls and they
%% bring in essential packages for graphics and font handling.
%% Note that due to the \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{} call it is no longer necessary
%% to provide the the path and extension of a graphics file:
%% \includegraphics{diamondrule} is completely sufficient.
