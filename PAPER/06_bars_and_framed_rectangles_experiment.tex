\section{Bars and Framed Rectangles Experiment}

Visual cues can help converting graphical elements back to their real world variables. Cleveland and McGill introduced the bars and framed rectangles experiment which judges the elementary perceptual task of position along non-aligned scales~\cite{cleveland_mcgill}. 

\subsection{Hypotheses}

We proposed two hypotheses entering the elementary perceptual task experiment:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{H4.1} \textbf{Classifiers can leverage additional visual cues.} The original bar and framed rectangle experiment shows how visual cues aid humans in mapping graphical elements to quantitative variables. This should be the same for feed-forward neural networks since they are inspired by the visual system.
	\item \textbf{H4.2} \textbf{Weber's law can be transferred to computational perception.} Cleveland and McGill confirmed Weber's law based on the bar and framed rectangle experiment. For humans, the ability to perceive change within a distribution is proportional to the size of the initial distribution.
\end{itemize}

For humans, it is easier to decide which of two bars represent a larger height if a scale is introduced by adding framed rectangles (right). In this case, the right bar is heigher as visible with less free space when adding the frame. We evaluate whether such a visual aid also helps machines to perceive visually encoded quantities.}

\subsection{Weber-Fechner's Law}

As identified by Cleveland and McGill, the bar and framed rectangle experiment is closely related to Weber's law. This psychophysics law states that perceivable difference within a distribution is proportional to the initial size of the distribution. Weber's law goes hand-in-hand with Fechner's law. We conduct an additional experiment based on the original illustrations of the Weber-Fechner law to investigate whether this law can be applied to computational perception of our classifiers (Fig.~\ref{fig:webers_law}).

\begin{figure}[t]
	  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{weber_overview}
  \caption{\textbf{Weber-Fechner Law.} The Weber-Fechner law states that the perceivable differences within a distribution is proportional to the initial size of the distribution. The lower square contains 10 more dots than the upper one on both sides. However, the difference is easily perceivable on the left while the squares on the right almost look the same. We generate rasterized visualizations similar to this setup and evaluate our classifiers.}

\subsection{Results}

First run indicates that framed rectangles perform better but we dont really know it yet.
