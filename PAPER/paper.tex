\section{Experimental Setup}

The experiments shown in this paper are either regression or classification tasks. We formulate any estimation of quantities (e.g. angles, positions, lengths etc.) as a regression problem between $0$ and $1$. The output indicates the percentage in regards to the degrees of freedom of the individual experiment. If the experiment involves a choice, we formulate it as a classification problem.

\subsection{Measures}

\textbf{Accuracy.} We use the same metric as Cleveland McGill to measure accuracy.
\begin{equation}
	\log_2( | \textnormal{predicted percent} - \textnormal{true percent} | + .125)
\end{equation}

\noindent{\textbf{Efficiency.}} We use the convergence rate based on the decrease of loss per training epoch as an indicator for the efficiency of the classifier in combination with a visual encoding. For regression tasks the loss is defined as mean squared error (MSE) and for classification tasks the loss is categorical cross-entropy.

\subsection{Classifiers}

Our classifiers are built upon a multilayer perceptron (MLP) which is a feedforward artificial neural network. We combine this MLP with different convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for preprocessing and feature generation. These include the traditional LeNet trained from scratch, as well as VGG19 and Xception trained using ImageNet.
\\~\\
\noindent{\textbf{Multilayer Perceptron.}} The multilayer perceptron in this paper has $256$ neurons which are activated as rectified linear units. We then add a dropout layer to prevent overfitting and compute linear regression or classification (softmax).
\\~\\
\noindent{\textbf{Convolutional Neural Networks.}} We use CNNs to generate additional features as input to the MLP. For this, we train a \emph{LeNet} classifier with different samples for each experiment. 

All networks are trained with the same parameters.

Cleveland McGills Ranking - can we observe something similar?

1. Position along a common scale e.g. scatter plot

2. Position on identical but nonaligned scales e.g. multiple scatter plots

3. Length e.g. bar chart

4.Angle \& Slope (tie) e.g. pie chart

5. Area e.g. bubbles

6. Volume, density, and color saturation (tie) e.g. heatmap

7. Color hue e.g. newsmap
