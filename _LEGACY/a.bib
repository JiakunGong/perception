  Abstract = {{We consider the problem of designing models to leverage a recently introduced
approximate model averaging technique called dropout. We define a simple new
model called maxout (so named because its output is the max of a set of inputs,
and because it is a natural companion to dropout) designed to both facilitate
optimization by dropout and improve the accuracy of dropout's fast approximate
model averaging technique. We empirically verify that the model successfully
accomplishes both of these tasks. We use maxout and dropout to demonstrate
state of the art classification performance on four benchmark datasets: MNIST,
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN.}},

  Abstract = {Our hybrid display model combines multiple automultiscopic elements
  volumetrically to support horizontal and vertical parallax at a larger
  depth of field and better accommodation cues compared to single layer
  elements. In this paper, we introduce a framework to analyze the
  bandwidth of such display devices. Based on this analysis, we show
  that multiple layers can achieve a wider depth of field using less
  bandwidth compared to single layer displays. We present a simple
  algorithm to distribute an input light field to multiple layers,
  and devise an efficient ray tracing algorithm for synthetic scenes.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by both software
  simulation and two corresponding hardware prototypes.},

  Review = {Sand and Teller \cite{Sand:2008:PV} introduced the particle vidoe problem that estimates particles with long-duration trajectory and other properties. The resultant motion is desner than feature matching and longer range than optical flow. On complex vidoe sequences with occlusion, their estimation method produces results with low drift. The particle video method has been used as a preprocessing step in several novel video applications by Godman \etal (though the preprocessing is time-consuming; particle video is good for slowly moving, large textured objects, but fail for fast moving, small objects, or larger featureless regions). Estimation is based on the Brox \etal \cite{Brox:2004:HAO} The implementation of the temporal appearance smoothness assumption is ad-hoc. Occlusion is still a problem. Theoretical framework is not set up. Positioning particles is ad-hoc, not part of the objective function. %related work Most optical flow estimation methods assume each pixel goes to somewhoe in the next frame, which is violated by occlusion. Multi-frame optical esimation: temporal smoothness assumption is usually violated by real-world video sequences; rank method may be incorporated into the particle video estimation. Their occlusion handling is based on Thompson \cite{Thompson:1998:EDOF} and Xiao \etal \cite{Xiao:2006:BFO}},
