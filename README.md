# Evaluating 'Graphical Perception' with CNNs

This is the repository accompanying for the code, data, and results of our paper.

Things are being updated and cleaned up right now, however, a good starting point to run other networks on the 'elementary perceptual tasks' is here: https://github.com/Rhoana/perception/blob/master/IPY/Figure1.ipynb

And for 'position-angle': https://github.com/Rhoana/perception/blob/master/IPY/Figure3.ipynb

And for 'position-length': https://github.com/Rhoana/perception/blob/master/IPY/Figure4.ipynb

And for the 'bars and framed rectangle' experiment: https://github.com/Rhoana/perception/blob/master/IPY/Figure12.ipynb

And finally, for 'Webers Law': https://github.com/Rhoana/perception/blob/master/IPY/Weber_Fechner_Law.ipynb

Also, here is the code for training and testing the regression: https://github.com/Rhoana/perception/blob/master/EXP/run_regression.py

Other good stuff is hidden in IPY/ and EXP/ - please browse :)

THANK YOU
