-> fix fig 12 (old code)
-> create fixed testset
-> restructure IPY
-> create possibility to run on cluster
-> create classifiers
 -> Random Forest on parametrization
 -> NN
 -> CNN
 -> ResNet50
-> experiment with random width

-> create simple encodings for figure 1 of cleveland mcgill

-> create multi regression problem

# Which chart would you choose? Probably the bar chart. 
#
# The difference was first studied by Cleveland and McGill.
#
# Nowadays not only us as humans perceive the world: many computer vision tasks are handled by CNNs
#
# Would CNNs prefer the bar chart?
#
# We tested multiple classifiers by replicating the experiments of cleveland mcgill:
#
# elementary perceptual tasks such as the measurement of curvature, angles, length and positions
#
# and the position-angle experiment which compares pie and bar charts
#
# as well as the position-length experiment 
#
# and the bar framed rectangles experiment built upon webers law of just noticable differences
#
# after careful quantitative evaluation as one result, we propose a ranking of visual encodings best suited towards modern CNNs
#
# all our code, data, and results are publicly available on github


#
# Which chart would you choose? Hopefully the bar chart!
#
# This was first studied by Cleveland and McGill.
#
# But now, not only humans see the world. In fact many computer vision tasks are handled by CNNs.
#
# Can CNNs measure curvature and angles? Can they judge lengths or find positions on a common scale?
#
# Would they prefer bar charts over pie charts?
#
# please come to our talk to find out
